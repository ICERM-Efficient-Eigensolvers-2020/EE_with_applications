# Summer@ICERM 2020: Efficient Eigensolvers And Their Applications
<img src="ICERM_logoCUBE_1000pxls.png" width="200" height="200" />

> Welcome to our webpage for Efficient Eigensolvers! blabla

We implemented two major kinds of eigensolvers:
* Based on converged sequences
* Based on Eigenvalue-revealing factorizations


## Eigensolvers
### [Power Iteration](PowerIterationMethod.html)

### [Inverse Iteration with/without Shift]()

### [QR Algorithm](QR_Algorithm.html)
 
We also introduced other variants involving different techniques.
### [Rayleigh Quotient Iteration](RayleighQuotientIteration.html) 

## Webcrawler
A common application for eigensolvers, more specifically, the Power Iteration Method,
is PageRank. By crawling all the subpages under a given domain, we generated a directed 
graph with vertices representing subpages and directed edges representing linkages.
